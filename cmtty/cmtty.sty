%%% This file now simply sets \ttdefault to use Latin Modern
%%% Typewriter rather than doing more work to use Computer Modern
%%% Typewriter.  It's meant mostly as a shim for documents using
%%% the old cmtty package.

\typeout{This is package cmtty.sty.}


%%% Use Latin Modern Typewriter as the monospace typeface.
